Changelog for OpenFrame::Segment::Apache

1.05 Thu Dec 19 15:43:55 GMT 2002
	- minor code cleanup

	- fix embarrassing bug where cookies weren't being sent properly

1.03 Thu Sep 26 16:27:48 BST 2002

	- now use the new OpenFrame::Argument::Blob so that file

1.02 Thu Sep 26 15:28:13 BST 2002
	- new OpenFrame::Segment::Apache::NoImages which lets Apache
	serve images for us (and framework to make this work and tests
