NAME
    OpenFrame::Segment::Apache - Apache segments for OpenFrame 3

SYNOPSIS
      # tricky to explain, but mostly:
      PerlHandler YourHandler

DESCRIPTION
    The OpenFrame::Segment::Apache distribution provides segments for
    OpenFrame 3 that convert from Apache requests to OpenFrame::Request
    objects and from OpenFrame::Response objects to produce an Apache
    response.

    It will be demonstrated with a simple OpenFrame example which simply
    loads static content, OpenFrame::Example::ApacheSimple.

    The following configuration should be in httpd.conf:

      SetHandler  perl-script
      PerlSetVar  cwd /home/website/
      # PerlSetVar  debug 1
      PerlHandler OpenFrame::Example::ApacheSimple

    The actual handler is quite short. The important part is to set up a
    pipeline which has a OpenFrame::Segment::Apache::Request segment at the
    beginning and a OpenFrame::Segment::Apache::Response as a cleanup
    segment.

    Note that there is also a "OpenFrame::Segment::Apache::NoImages" which
    declines and lets Apache serve images.
